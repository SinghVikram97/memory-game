# Memory Game Project

## What is Memory Game
  This is a simple game built to test a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different 
  icons. 


## Challenge
   Match cards in less time with less moves.

## Instructions
   * Click on a card
   * Keep revealing cards and working your memory to remember each unveiled card.
   * Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time

## How I built the Memory Game
   I manipulated the DOM with Vanilla JS, altered part of the HTML and also styled the game
   * Created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
   * Created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
   * Added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
   * Create a pop-up modal when player wins game
